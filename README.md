Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building and maintaining software in a structured and organised way.
Its importances include; 
1. Creates jobs and opportunities- The tech world is booming and software engineering is one of the most in demand skills.
2. Protects our information- Cybersecurity is a big deal today and software engineers help protect sensitive data from hackers.
3. Make life easier- Software engineering bring convenience to our daily lives by creating tools that help us communicate, work and have fun.
4. Drives innovation- Software engineering is at the heart of the tech thats shaping the future.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Software Crisis and British of Software Engineering (1968)- As software projects grew in size, companies struggled with delays, high costs and unreliable systems. This led to the 1968 NATO Conference where experts coined the term software engineering pushing for structured approaches like the Waterfall Model to bring order to the chaos.
2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980-1990)- Writing and maintaining complex software became a challenge so developers embraced Object-Oriented Programming(OOP). Language like C++ and Java introduced concepts like encapsulation and inheritance making code reusable, scalable and easier to manage.
3. The Agile Revolution(2001- Present)- Traditional methods like Waterfall were too rigid for fast-changing projects. In 2001 the Agile Manifesto introduced a new way of working. Agile methods like Scrum and Kanban are now industry standards.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning- This where everything starts. The team figures out what they want to build and how much time and money it will take.
2. Requirement Analysis- Developers and stakeholders discuss what the software needs to do ensuring it meets user needs and business goals.
3. Design- The technical blueprint is created- how the software will look, how data will flow and how different patrs will connect.
4. Implementation(Coding)- Developers write the actual code bringing the design to life and building the software features.
5. Testing- Before launching the software is tested to find  and fix bugs, security issues or anything that could affect performance.
6. Deployment- Once everything looks good the software is released to users either all at once or in stages.
7. Maintenance- After launch, updates, bug fixes and improvements keep the software funning smoothly and up to date.  

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In Waterfall everything is planned upfront while in Agile planning is adaptive and continuous.
In Waterfall approach is linear and sequential while in Agile approach is iterative and flexible.
Waterfall is best for large, well defined projects while Agile is best for dynamic and evolving projects.
In Waterfall testing is done at the end after development is complete while in Agile theres continuous testing throughout development.
Theres one final release at the end of Waterfall while thers frequent smaller releases in Agile.
Examples include : Waterfall- Building a government system with strict documentation and approval processes. Because regulatory constraints often require detailed planning before execution.
Agile- Developing a mobile app startup with evolving customer needs. Because Agile allows frequent updates based on user feedback. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer;
   a. Fixes bugs and improves sotware performance.
   b. Uses tools like Git, VS Code, Github and programming languanges such as python.
   c. Writes, tests and maintains code for applications.
2. Quality Assurance(QA) Engineers;
   a. Ensures that the software meets quality standards before release.
   b. Uses automated and manual testing techniques.
   c. Designs and runs tests to find bugs and performance issues.
3. Project Manager;
   a. Uses tools like Trello, Jira or Agile methodologies for tracking progress.
   b. Manages project timelines, budgets and team coordination.
   c. Oversees the software development process to ensure timely and successful delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments are software tools that provide a complete environment for coding, debugging and testing programs. Examples include PyCharm, Eclipse and VS Code.
2. Version Control Systems track changes in code allowing multiple developers tgo colllaborate efficiently and revert to previous versions if needed. Examples include Mercurial, Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging headaches- Use print statements, take breaks when stuck and use debugging tools.
2. Messy code- Write clean, readable code with good naming and comments.
3. Slow software performance- identify slow parts with profiling tools, optimize code and reduce unnecessary operations.
4. Changing project requirements- Communicate clearly with stakeholders and flexible with Agile methods.
5. Time and deadline stress- Break tasks into smaller steps, priotize and use tools like trello.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing- Checks smalls pieces of code to ensure they work right. It catches small bugs early and makes fixing issues cheaper and easier.
2. Integration testing- Tests how different parts of the system work together. It prevents breakdowns when modules interact and catches issues like API failures and data mismatches.
3. System testing- Tests the whole software to see if everything runs smoothly. It finds performance, security and usability issues. It also ensures the system works as expected.
4. Acceptance testing- Checks if the software meets user needs before launch. It ensures its user-friendly and ready to release. It also avoids costly post-launch fixes.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the skill of asking AI the right way to get answers.
Why it matters;
a. No need for endless clarification thus saves time.
b.From writing to coding a good prompt makes AI more eefective.
c. Better AI responses thus clear prompts.
d. Reduces misunderstandings thus its more accurate.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example "tell me about cars". Improved prompt "Give me a quick summary of electric cars- what makes them great their downsides and some popular models.
Why the improved prompt is more effective;
a. Its easy to understand. Feels natural.
b. Its more focused. Instead of all cars its focused on electric cars.
c. The AI now gives useful structured information instead of guessing what you want.
